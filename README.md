#### Let's play with the fundamental concepts of deep learning here

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Implemented CNN from scratch in C++ and Python

# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Implemented RNN from scratch in Python

# Knowledge Distillation

Trained a larger CNN model to classify images, and transferred the learning to a smaller network. This technique, known as knowledge distillation, was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531
